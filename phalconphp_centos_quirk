Hello.
I want to install Phalcon :
CODE: SELECT ALL
http://phalconphp.com/en/download
to VestaCP.I use CentOS 6.5 64bit and last verion of VestaCP.
I follow install process of Phalcon and all go normal:
CODE: SELECT ALL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries have been installed in:
   /root/cphalcon/build/64bits/modules

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Build complete.
Don't forget to run 'make test'.

Installing shared extensions:     /usr/lib64/php/modules/

Thanks for compiling Phalcon!
Build succeed: Please restart your web server to complete the installation

I search for all "php.ini" files in server and add:
CODE: SELECT ALL
extension=  /usr/lib64/php/modules/phalcon.so
Results are that after few restarts <?php phpinfo(); ?> not show that Phalcon module is ON. 
Please help me !
Thanks

YES
After hours of search and writing of this question i found answer!!!
CODE: SELECT ALL
This is due to the way PHP is packaged in CentOS: http://forum.phalconphp.com/discussion/664/after-upgrading-from-php5-5-to-php5-5-1-an-error-occurs

In brief, just create a file /etc/php.d/zzzzz.ini with ```text extension=phalcon.so ```

and restart the web server; this should do the trick.
